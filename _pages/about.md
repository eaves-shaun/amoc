AMOC-SHIFT is a scientific research project (2026-2029) that aims to to better constrain the impacts to Southern Hemisphere climate and cryosphere from a future weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

The AMOC is a major ocean current system that helps regulate global climate—could reshape climate patterns in the Southern Hemisphere and affect the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Evidence suggests AMOC is weakening and could cross a tipping point in the future, however most existing studies focus on Northern Hemisphere impacts. This project addresses a major gap by providing the first detailed modelling of Southern Hemisphere climate and cryosphere responses to AMOC collapse.

Using cutting-edge climate and ice sheet models, we will simulate how AMOC collapse influences temperature, wind patterns, ocean currents, and sea level, with a particular focus on heat transport to Antarctica. It will also assess how these changes affect the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s long-term mass balance and potential contributions to sea-level rise.

This project is supported by the Marsden Fund, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand. Led by researchers at Victoria University of Wellington, the project involves collaborators from Australia, USA, the Netherlands, and Germany.
