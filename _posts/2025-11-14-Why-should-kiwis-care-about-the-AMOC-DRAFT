The title of this post seems an obvious question given that NZ is situated in the south Pacific Ocean, about as far as you can get from the Atlantic where the strongest impacts of an AMOC shutdown would be felt. 

But the world is strongly interconnected on many levels. 

Take the oceans for starters. While we have assigned names and boundary to the various basins water molecules are free to move between them, driven by wind and density currents. There lies our first connection. Ocean waters circulate, moving heat from one part of the planet to another. Areas of the planet that receive oceanic heat have their atmosphere warmed by it, while areas where heat is exported are cooled.
