A tipping point is a critical threshold at which a system abruptly shifts from one stable state to another. Although the forcing may be gradual, positive feedbacks can cause rapid change once the threshold is crossed, and the resulting impacts are often hard or impossible to reverse on human timescales.

This can sound quite abstract, so consider the famous expression “the straw that broke the camel’s back.” Imagine a camel being slowly loaded with straw. Each piece is light and makes almost no difference on its own. But with every addition, the total load increases. Eventually, a threshold is reached where just one more piece of straw makes the load exceed what the camel can carry. The final straw isn’t special by itself — but it pushes the system past its limit.

Another example, more directly tied to the idea of “tipping,” is a simple balance scale. Suppose one side holds a weight, and you slowly add grains of sand to the other side. Each grain is insignificant on its own, but their cumulative weight grows. At some point the sand matches and then exceeds the counterweight, and the scales suddenly tip to the other side. Again, the shift is abrupt, even though the input changed gradually.

Tipping points exist all around us in nature. In climate science, there are many prominent examples:
* Atmospheric and ocean warming can cause ice sheet melt, which may accelerate due to positive feedbacks (e.g. surface darkening, elevation lowering)
* Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases that lead to further warming and thus thawing
* Gradual changes in the density structure of the oceans due to freshwater addition (e.g. more rain, ice melt) may cause ocean currents, like AMOC, to stop flowing
