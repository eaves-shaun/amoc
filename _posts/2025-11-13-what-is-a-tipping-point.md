Simply put, a tipping point is threshold that defines the transition between two quite different states.

That sounds quite vague and abstract, so consider this famous example: *"the straw that broke the camel's back"*. In this example, one can imagine a camel being slowly loaded up, piece by piece, with straw to transport somewhere. Individually, each piece of straw doesn't weigh very much at all. But each with each addition to the camel's load, the pile gets heavier. Eventually, a threshold is crossed, whereby the weight of just one more piece of straw means the load now exceeds the strength of the camel.

Tipping points exist all around us in nature. In climate science, there are many prominent examples:
* Warming causes ice sheets to melt, which darkens and lowers their surfaces, which causes more melt
* Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases that lead to further warming and thus thawing
* Gradual changes in the density structure of the oceans may cause ocean currents, like AMOC, to stop flowing
